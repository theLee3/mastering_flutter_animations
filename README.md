# Mastering Flutter Animations

This series is designed to provide a better understanding of Flutter's animation framework through a collection of small projects demonstrating various features & techniques.

Each directory contains a separate project and a `README.md` describing the project and linking to the accompanying learning resources. Each project contains a `starter` folder to be used when following the guide, as well as a `complete` folder containing the finished product should you simply want to explore the code.
